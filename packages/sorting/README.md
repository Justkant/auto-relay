# AutoRelay 
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/auto-relay.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/auto-relay)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wemaintain/auto-relay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wemaintain/auto-relay)

AutoRelay is a librairy designed to work alongside [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.ml/) and make it easy to paginate your results using the [Relay spec](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm).

Please note this is currently a W.I.P, expect frequent breaking changes in the API until 1.0.0

AutoRelay is meant to be *plug and play* with TypeGraphQL and TypeORM (*more orm support such as sequelize-typescript could be supported*). Simply decorate your relations with `@RelayedConnection` as such:
```typescript
@Entity()
@ObjectType()
class User {
  @OneToMany(() => Recipe)
  @RelayConnection(() => Recipe)
  recipes: Recipe[];
}
```

This will result in the following working SDL:
```graphql
// Autogenrated by AutoRelay
type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
  endCursor: String!
}

// AutoGenerated by AutoRelay
type UserRecipeConnection {
  edges: [UserRecipeEdge]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

// AutoGenerated by AutoRelay
type UserRecipeEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: Recipe!
}

type Recipe {
  // ...
}

type User {
  recipes(...): UserRecipeConnection
}
```

where `User.recipes` is now a fully working field resolver, that automatically takes Relay ConnectionArguments (*first, before, after, last*) and returns a Relay Connection containing the results.


## Installation

*This lib is meant to be used with TypeGraphQL. It will not work with other code-first graphql librairies* 


1. Install the npm package:

    `npm install auto-relay --save`

2. (Install an ORM *if you plan to use `@RelayedConnection`*)

    *currently only TypeORM is supported*

    `npm install @auto-relay/typeorm`


## Quick Start

Simply configure AutoRelay to use your ORM of choice, and you're ready to go !

*index.ts*
```typescript
import { TypeOrmConnection } from '@auto-relay/typeorm'
import { AutoRelayConfig } from 'auto-relay'

new AutoRelayConfig({ orm: () => TypeOrmConnection })

```



## Step-by-step guide
AutoRelay was designed with two goals in mind : Firstly, to automate the pagination between two entities that share a relationship in TypeORM. Secondly, to make it easy and boilerplate-free to implement your own Relay logic. This guide will showcase both of those.

### Making a relationship relayable.
Let's say you currently have two entities / graphql objects, `User` and `Recipe`. A recipe is always linked to an user, and a given user can have multiple recipes. Your classes might look like that :

```typescript
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number;

  @Column()
  @Field()
  name: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Recipe)
  @Field(() => [Recipe])
  recipes: Recipe[]
}

export class Recipe {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number;

  @Column()
  @Field(() => Int)
  rating: number

  @ManyToOne(() => User)
  user: User
}
```

With some custom logic (either lazy-loading or field resolvers) to fetch User.recipes / Recipe.user.

With AutoRelay, we're gonna replace all that logic with a single decorator, `@RelayedConnection`. 

Our `User` will now look like this :

```typescript
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number;

  @Column()
  @Field()
  name: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Recipe)
  @RelayedConnection(() => Recipe)
  recipes: Recipe[]
}
```

This will auto-magically create a few GraphQL types, such as `UserRecipeConnection` and `UserRecipeEdge`. Our User.recipes field now takes Relay's ConnectionArguments and returns `UserRecipeConnection!`.

Our TypeORM integration gets the repository for `Recipe`, translates the ConnectionArguments to an offset/limit tuple and fetches recipes connected to this `User`.


### Making a Query Relayable
Let's imagine we now have an `users` query, that we want to paginate using Relay. AutoRelay offers a few helpers with that.

```typescript
@Resolver(of => User)
export class UserResolver {

  constructor(
    protected readonly userRepository: Repository<User>
  )

  @RelayedQuery(() => User)
  async users(
    @RelayLimitOffset() {limit, offset}: RelayLimitOffsetArgs
  ): Promise<[number, User[]]> {
    return this.userRepository.findAndCount({ 
      where: { 
        // any business logic you might have
      },
      skip: offset,
      take: limit
    })
  }

}
```

And that's it! Again, AutoRelay has taken care under the hood of a few things:
1. It's created all the necessary GraphQL types for us.
2. It's ensured the `users` query expects Connection Arguments, but conveniently translated them to limit/offset for us.
3. It takes the return of our `findAndCount` calls and automatically transforms it to a Relay `Connection` as expected by GraphQL.


### Extending edges (relationship metadata)
Often, we have relationships that contains metadata. This is particulary the case for N:M relationships, where the join table might contain data our graphql client might want.

AutoRelay offers a simple API to extend the returned `Edges` with information contained in a join table.


```typescript
class EntityA {

    // [...]

    @OneToMany(() => JoinEntity)
    joinEntity: JoinEntity
}

class EntityB {

    // [...]

    @OneToMany(() => JoinEntity)
    joinEntity: JoinEntity
}

class JoinEntity {

  @Column()
  @Field()
  metadata: string;

  @ManyToOne(() => EntityA)
  entityA: EntityA

  @ManyToOne(() => EntityB)
  entityB: EntityB

}
```

Let's say we want EntityB to be queryable with Relay arguments from EntityA. Our code would simply become :

```typescript
class EntityA {

    // [...]

    @OneToMany(() => JoinEntity)
    joinEntity: JoinEntity

    @RelayedConnection(model => EntityB, through => JoinEntity)
    entitiesB: EntityB[];
}
```

This would result in the following working SDL: 

```graphql
type EntityA {
  // ...
  entitiesB: EntitiesAToBConnection!
}

type EntityB {
  // ...
}

type EntitiesAToBConnection {
  edges: [EntityAToBEdge]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type EntityAToBEdge {
  cursor: String!
  metadata: String!
  node: EntityB
}
```
